                                <p>The BMW M1 is the first car to be solely developed by BMW M and employs a 3,453 cc (3.5 L) M88/1 petrol six-cylinder engine with Kugelfischer-Bosch mechanical fuel injection and Magneti-Marelli ignition system. The engine
                                    was developed by Paul Rosche, who was also responsible for the S14 inline-4 engine and the S70/2 V12 engine. A version of this engine was later used in the South African version of the 745i, of which 209 examples were
                                    built between 1984 and 1986, as well as the E24 M6/M635CSi and E28 M5. The engine has six separate throttle bodies, twin-cams, 4 valves per cylinder, and generates a power output of 277 PS (204 kW; 273 hp) at 6,500
                                    rpm and 330 N⋅m (243 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 5,000 rpm in the road version, giving the car a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph). The engine was mated to a 5-speed manual transmission made by ZF Friedrichshafen equipped with
                                    a 40% locking limited slip differential.

                                <p>If you’re a fan of fast saloons from the 80’s and you’d love to just have one resting in your driveway, bidding for this E28 BMW M5 is the way to go. The E28 M5 made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show in February 1984,
                                    utilizing a 535xi chassis, housing a 3.5-liter six-cylinder petrol engine, good for 282HP (286PS). This particular one, since it’s a 1988 North American model, comes with the S38B35 engine, which had a catalytic converter
                                    and put down 256hp. Not bad at all considering the car’s curb weight of 1,550 kg (3,417 lbs).

                                    In countries where the M3 was sold with a catalytic converter, the initial versions were rated at 143 kW (195 PS; 192 hp) and had a top speed of 235 km/h (146 mph).In countries where a catalytic converter was not fitted,
                                    the engine was rated at 147 kW (200 PS; 197 hp).

                                <p>The M8 was originally envisioned as a Ferrari competitor equipped with a special 558 PS (410 kW; 550 hp) version of the S70 engine, with modifications including a displacement increase to 6.1 litres, dual camshafts for
                                    each cylinder bank, individual throttle bodies with roller valves, four valves per cylinder head, carbon fibre intake manifolds and continuously variable valve timing. As a result it was estimated the M8 would achieve
                                    a top speed of 198mph. A common misconception is that this engine powered the McLaren F1. The S70/2 used in the McLaren F1 was not based directly on the prototype 4-valve V12 used in the M8, and was a completely new
                                    design.

                                <p>Starting in September 2001, the engines were upgraded to the BMW S54 engine from the E46 M3. In most countries, it is rated at 239 kW (321 hp) at 7,400 rpm and 354 N⋅m (261 lb⋅ft) at 4,900 rpm, while North American models
                                    have 235 kW (315 bhp) at 7,400 rpm and 341 N⋅m (252 lb⋅ft) at 4,900 rpm. The difference in peak power and torque is due to the catalytic converters being located closer to the engine on the North American spec cars,
                                    which allows the catalysts to heat up faster and reduce cold start emissions. A total of 1,112 cars were built with the S54 engine.

                                <p>The BMW S85 is a 5.0 L (305 cu in) V10 engine which generates a power output of 373 kW (507 PS; 500 hp) at 7,750 rpm and 520 N⋅m (384 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,100 rpm.The S85 was exclusively used in the E60 M5 (and related
                                    E63/E64 M6) and is not based on any other engine. There are three driver-selectable engine modes: P400, P500 and P500 S. P400, the default start-up mode, limits the engine to 294 kW (400 PS; 394 hp). P500 increases
                                    power to the full 373 kW (507 PS; 500 hp). The P500 S mode keeps the engine at the same power output as the P500 mode but adds a more sensitive throttle response.

                                    Elmitt. The M6 had two modes for engine power: a "P400" mode in which the engine has a rated power output of 294 kW (394 hp) and a "P500" mode in which the engine has a rated power output of 373 kW (500 hp).Manufacturer
                                    claimed performance included a 0-62 mph (100 km/h) acceleration time of 4.6 seconds.The top speed was electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) or 305 km/h (190 mph) if the optional M-driver's package is fitted.

                                <p>At first glance many enthusiasts cried as BMW decided to swap in a V8 and increase weight. But the E92 M3 brought much more to the table. The E92 debuted as a coupe in 2008 followed by a bloated E93 convertible and a suburbanites
                                    dream, the E90 M3 sedan. Even though a V8 was used, the ///M engineers magically kept its weight close to its predecessors. The 4.0-liter V8 engine produced 414 HP at 8,300 RPM to deliver 0-60 MPH in 3.9 seconds (DCT
                                    Transmission), putting it on a par with many contemporary supercars and was surprisingly more economical at 22.8 MPG. The one area of disappointment was the V8’s torque figure, a measly 295 ft-lbs, which is similar
                                    to the older E46 M3’s inline 6 cylinder. </p>
